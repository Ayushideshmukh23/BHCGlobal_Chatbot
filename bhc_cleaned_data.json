    "content": "powered byBHC Global Despite massive investments in AMI and smart grid infrastructure\u2014and over 1.2 billion smart meters installed globally\u2014most utilities are still only operationalizing a fraction of the potential insights. This challenge is becoming even more pronounced as utilities move to AMI 2.0, which promises higher velocity and unprecedented granularity. OurAMI Insight Acceleratorbrings together a powerful suite of AI-powered, best-of-breed analytics platforms with seamless integration into utilities\u2019 existing IT and OT environments. This unlocks a powerful catalog of cutting-edge use cases that deliver immediate value to both the enterprise and its customers. Given the speed with which the smart grid is evolving, it is becoming difficult for even the largest AMI vendors and analytics providers to provide universal coverage across every functional use case, resulting in limited coverage or highly diluted use cases.That\u2019s why we have assembled a collection of domain-specific experts and pre-vetted solutionstailored to the unique functional challenges and business strategies critical to today\u2019s industry transition. Our analytics are designed to work across any hardware or software platforms underpinning your AMI deployment. This means every analytics insight performed or use case developed can evolve with you, regardless of which vendors you use now or in the future. You always have best-of-breed solutions on the field with you, giving you maximum flexibility at every step. Our portfolio of AMI intelligence use cases is unmatched, with over 65 use cases ready to be deployed within your AMI environment. Our coverage is wide and deep, cutting across all major functions, business units, and application areas. From Grid Planning and Operations to Customer Experience, Energy Procurement, and Energy Resources, we\u2019ve got you covered. We also offer use cases that extend beyond the utility through our consent-driven third-party intelligence platform. BHC Global and our network of specialized integration partners work to connect AMI use cases seamlessly across your existing IT and OT digital portfolio. This includes accessing and conditioning data from the head-end system, MDM, and other parts of your metering ecosystem, then channeling insights into the systems that apply them in real operational context. Many of these integrations are preconfigured and already compatible with leading enterprise software platforms. Requires AMI 2.0 All of our use cases and blueprints have been architected by domain experts who have led the application of analytics successfully in actual utility settings. This bench of experts has shaped use cases across grid strategy, planning, operations, energy trading, risk management, customer engagement, complex rates, and countless others. Utilities using our AMI accelerator can access this expertise throughout use case implementation and deployment to drive value in every application. Not every utility is at the same stage in their AMI journey. Some are still using analog or AMI meters. Many are mid-cycle with AMI 1.0 and just beginning to consider plans for replacement. Others are well down the path of deploying AMI 2.0 grid connected technology and gaining access to a wealth of high-velocity intelligence. Our solutions work across all stages of this journey, from AMI 1.0 deployment through upgrade cycles, helping you capture value at every phase. Our AMI Insight Accelerator provides full training and coaching to your employees and users for any deployed use cases. Those applying the insights understand the role of the data and how it will be utilized for reporting, visualization, and decision-making. This keeps your organization aligned and empowered as it evolves into a more data- and intelligence-driven culture.
